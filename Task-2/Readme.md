                                     Explanation:

     Import Libraries: 
     Imports all necessary libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

     Load Dataset: 
     Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

     Data Exploration: 
     Displays basic information about the dataset and visualizes it.

     Data Preprocessing: 
     Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and standardizes the features.

     Model Initialization:      
     Initializes Random Forest, SGD, and SVC classifiers.

     Model Training: 
     Trains the models on the scaled training data.

     Model Evaluation: 
     Makes predictions and evaluates the models using confusion matrices and classification reports.

     Visualization: 
     Plots confusion matrices for each classifier to visualize their performance.
